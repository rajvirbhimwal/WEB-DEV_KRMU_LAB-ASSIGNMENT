Project Overview

Fashionista is a responsive, accessible, and visually-driven fashion platform prototype built using only HTML and CSS (with minimal, optional JavaScript for non-essential UI enhancements). The project demonstrates layout design, responsive breakpoints, CSS Grid and Flexbox usage, typography, and visual branding suitable for a portfolio capstone. It includes examples of product listing pages, product detail pages, a homepage with hero/banner, a simple navigation system, and a mock checkout/cart UI (static/mock only — no backend).

Key Features

Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile (mobile-first approach).

Clean, modern UI using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Homepage with hero section, featured collections, and promotional banners.

Product listing (grid) with filters and sorting UI (static).

Product detail page with image gallery, size/colour selection UI (static).
